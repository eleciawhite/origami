Origami patterns I've developed (with links to other patterns). All pictures are of things I have folded with notes in a readme and filename if it wasn't of my design.

# Additional resources


## Curved Folds
If you don't know about curved folding, well, it is my favorite. I recommend [Curved Folding Origami Design by Jun Mitani](https://www.amazon.com/Curved-Folding-Origami-Design-Jun-Mitani/dp/0367180251/) and [his website](http://mitani.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/).

Also, if you don't know about [Amanda Ghassaei's Origami Simulator](http://www.amandaghassaei.com/projects/origami_simulator/), it is amusing and has neat crease and cut patterns in the examples.

## Precreasing
I did some precreasing by hand. Then I wanted a laser cutter after talking to [origami expert Robert Lang on our podcast](https://embedded.fm/episodes/313). I ended up with a [Cricut Maker](https://cricut.com/en_us/cricut-maker) at 1/10th the price. It isn't perfect for this but it is a lot more fun than doing it by hand.

(I don't know how to share projects in Cricut's Design Space but if you know and want the project, let me know and we can figure it out.)

## Other Favorite Books

* [Tessalations for Everyone by Ilan Garibi](https://www.amazon.com/Origami-Tessellations-Everyone-Original-Designs/dp/9659270003/). Tesselations are meditative and the results are very pretty. This book makes the imposssibly complicated a step by step process and the grounding to let you try out your own ideas.

* [Spirals by Tomoko Fuse](https://viereck-verlag.de/en/produkt/spiral-origami-art-design/). The shells I've designed owe a lot to Fuse's spirals.

* [Origami Design Secrets by Robert Lang](https://www.amazon.com/Origami-Design-Secrets-Mathematical-Methods/dp/1568814364/): A weight tome with a wealth of detail. I've been reading it for a year and I still am only part way through. The text makes sense and makes it easier to look at origami directions to see the results (and how to make them better).
