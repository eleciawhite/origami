## Curved Folds
If you don't know about curved folding, well, it is my favorite. I recommend [Curved Folding Origami Design by Jun Mitani](https://www.amazon.com/Curved-Folding-Origami-Design-Jun-Mitani/dp/0367180251/) and [his website](http://mitani.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/).

Also, if you don't know about [Amanda Ghassaei's Origami Simulator](http://www.amandaghassaei.com/projects/origami_simulator/), it is amusing and has neat crease and cut patterns in the examples.

## Precreasing
I did some precreasing by hand. Then I wanted a laser cutter after talking to [origami expert Robert Lang on our podcast] (https://embedded.fm/episodes/313). I ended up with a [Cricut Maker] (https://cricut.com/en_us/cricut-maker) at 1/10th the price. It isn't perfect for this but it is a lot more fun than doing it by hand.

(I don't know how to share projects in Cricut's Design Space but if you know and want the project, let me know and we can figure it out.)
