These scripts are based on the [Spirals by Tomoko Fuse](https://viereck-verlag.de/en/produkt/spiral-origami-art-design/). 

The goal is to reproduce the patterns in the book. I tend to mess with the patterns futher, usually adding curves but other things too. Those will be in other directories (like [shells/turbinator.py](../shells/turninatory.py))
