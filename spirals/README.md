These scripts are based on the [Spirals by Tomoko Fuse](https://viereck-verlag.de/en/produkt/spiral-origami-art-design/). 

The goal is to reproduce the patterns in the book. I tend to mess with the patterns futher, usually adding curves but other things too. Those will be in other directories (like [shells/turbinator.py](../shells/turbinatory.py))

Note: if you want some SVGs or images of patterns and aren't comfortable with Python or progamming, hit the contact link on [Embedded](https://embedded.fm/contact)
