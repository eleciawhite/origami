This jellyfish is an abomination to fold, about halfway through, you start needing clamps to hold the legs in place and then the only way to get it all to stay is to mist it with water while the clamps are stil on. I think a vertical line where the legs fold in would be very helpful.

Still, this is somewhat intriguing. I've never seen a good origami jellyfish before...

It is the green one on the (octopus examples image)[../octopus/octos_example.jpg].

# Development
This was an accident. Conical style pattern can have blade style pleats (as see in [octopus](../octopus)) or 3d style pleat (as with [Mitani's Whipped Cream](MitaniWhippedCream.PNG)). I wanted to make an octopus with 3d pleats but went a little too far with ORI-REVO, not realizing it doesn't check that the paper doesn't cross itself (physical impossibility). 

If that didn't make sense, I recommend [Mitani's 3D Origami Art](https://www.amazon.com/3D-Origami-Art-Jun-Mitani-ebook-dp-B01HELDDX8/dp/B01HELDDX8) as a mathy sort of book looking at mostly curved designed.

I saved as crease pattern dfx, opened in ORIPA, saved as SVG. The used Affinity Designer on ipad to redraw the lines of interest.
