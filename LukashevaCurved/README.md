These scripts are based on [Curved Origami: Unlocking the Secrets of Curved Folding in Easy Steps](https://www.amazon.com/Curved-Origami-Unlocking-Secrets-Folding/dp/0997311991)by Ekaterina Lukasheva. 

The goal is to reproduce the patterns in the book and extend the A, B, and C curves definitions to build different tessellations. Hopefully the patterns will be uploadable into [Amanda Ghassaei's Origami Simulator](http://www.amandaghassaei.com/projects/origami_simulator/) for initial testing.
