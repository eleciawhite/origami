This is a collection of uncertainty. Except for [the luck dragon](luck_dragon.svg), that one is pretty neat ([see pic](pics/luck_dragon.jpeg)).

I'm not sure the others have a place yet.

The ziggurat may be a beehive. It folds ok. The stairs are kind of neat. 

The toroidbowl is unfoldable but can be cut in half to make generic seashells.

Mushroom is ok but it looks like a bolt more than a mushroom. The other mushrooms haven't been tested yet.
