Shell_t works to create a shell-like object. This was an accidental find when it became clear that (the toroid bowl)[../other/toroidbowl.svg] was not foldable. I cut it in half (the actual paper) and the two result made nice, somewhat generic shells.

The (chambered nautilus)[curvedChamberedNautilus.svg] was a more directed effort. After trying to fold the Chambered Nautilus in (Origami Sea Life)[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXN1AGC/] and getting stuck (again!) on step 21: the unholy crimping, I looked at the pattern and wondered if I could re-create it with curves. I got out some log-log paper and estimated some curves (ok, then I did it a few more times, this is version 8 and I'm not sure it really works). The outer part of the fold is ok but the paper curls under and the underside is pretty unsightly. Note that usually, I usually see straight lines pairing curved lines for this sort of effect but I did curving lines with curving lines (the flatter curve to get the general shape, the wavy curve to get the raw edges to tuck under). The outside of the shell will be the direction that the double curved lines are mountain. I recommend folding the flatter lines first since they end up curving opposite to the expected.
